# Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-for-Human-Computer-Interaction
"Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition for HCI: A hybrid CNN-LSTM system using MobileNetV2 and LSTM to classify dynamic hand gestures from video streams, enabling intuitive, contactless human-computer interaction. Trained on the Jester dataset (148,092 videos), it targets low-latency performance for VR and smart device control."
